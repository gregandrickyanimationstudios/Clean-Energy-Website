  <h2>Nuclear power</h2>

  <p><strong>A bad wrap</strong></p>
  <p>
    Nuclear power isn't that bad as you might think it is, Let us explain.
  </p>

  <h3>Two types</h3>
  <p>
    There are 2 types of Nuclear Power. It can be Fission or Fusion.
    Fission is splitting atoms, and Fusion is putting them back together.
    Currently we cannot do fusion, but we *can* de Fission! Splitting the atom
    can be very dangerous, but all of the safety persuasions are necessary.
  </p>

  <h3>How it works</h3>
  <p>
    What most Nuclear power plants use is atoms of Uranium 235. When the atoms
    split it releases tremendous energy. This is enough to power a 100 watt
    light bulb for over 690 years. Also Small Nuclear Reactor is more safe.
    (see Real Talk) Also If you see a Nuclear Power Plant. Just know that
    steam is coming from the cooling tower, not carbon dioxide.

    We are here to talk about clean energy, how it is both good and bad, and how
    it works. We think that fossil fuels are a thing of the past, and yes, that
    was a fantastic pun. If you're wondering where we get our information from,
    you should check our citation page up there! ☺

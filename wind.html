  <h2>Wind Turbines</h2>

  <p>
    First, in our adventure about clean power are wind turbines...
  </p>

  <h3>How do they work?</h3>
  <p>
    First, let's look at how it sources power from the wind. The wind spins the blades
    and the spinning blades power a motor inside the turbine and then wires lead underground
    to the grid or a battery. Did you know that there are two types of wind turbines?
    Well, they are classed into two categories, HAWTs and VAWTs. HAWTs are the most common,
    blades that look like a plane propeller that can generate 4.8 to 9.5 megawatts of electricity.
    VAWTs have blades that rotate around a vertical pole.
  </p>

  <h3>what are the downsides?</h3>
  <p>
    Let’s get into the downside of a wind turbine, starting with the fact that wind turbines
    are inefficient and vulnerable to storms or that birds and bats can fly into wind turbines,
    but the wind is also inconstant.
  </p>

  <h3>what are the upsides?</h3>
  <p>
    Now let’s look at the upside of having wind turbines. They are available almost anywhere
    and are usable during the day, the night, sunny, and cloudy but not stormy though.
  </p>

  <h3>What about the environment?</h3>
  <p>
    Now, let’s talk about how wind turbines affect the environment. Wind turbines are great
    sources of renewable energy because they don’t release anything toxic into the atmosphere
    like fossil fuels do. Also, there are new wind turbine farms or “wind farms” which are
    lines of wind turbines that produce tons of electricity all over the world.

  <p>
    We are here to talk about clean energy, how it is both good and bad, and how it works.
    We think that fossil fuels are a thing of the past, and yes, that was a fantastic pun.

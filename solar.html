  <h2>Solar Panels</h2>

  <p>Next Into our somewhat large adventure on clean energy are solar panels…</p>

  <h3>How does it work?</h3>
  <p>
    So what happens is that there are these things on the solar panel called solar cells,
    real creative I know, and in the cells are these things called semiconductors that
    are usually made out of silicon. When rays of sunlight hit those silicon atoms they
    get excited and start dancing around and, just like when you're dancing in a large
    group of people, they bump into each other and that creates electricity.
  </p>
  <p>
    So each of those solar cells is producing power and when you put a lot of these
    six-inch by six-inch cells together you will get a solar panel often thirty-six to
    make a solar module. And then you put on a thin layer of plastic or glass over it.
    Then you take a couple of solar modules to get a solar panel, which can be serious.
  </p>

  <h3>Where does power go?</h3>
  <p>
    Well, that depends if you’re off or on the grid. If you’re off the grid, they’re
    perfect because you can store the power in a battery for the nighttime, but the
    battery can be expensive. Well, when you're on the grid it can work where the power
    the solar panels generate electricity gets sent to the grid for money called “net
    metering” or you can make the power the solar panel generates can lower your power bill.
  </p>

  <h3>What are the downsides?</h3>
  <p>
    The downsides? Well, it might be obvious, but they only work during the day unlike
    other things on this site.

    We are here to talk about clean energy, how it is both good and bad, and how it works.
    We think that fossil fuels are a thing of the past, and yes, that was a fantastic pun.
    If you're wondering where we get our information from, you should check our citation
    page up there! ☺

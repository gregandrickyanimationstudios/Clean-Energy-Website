  <h2>Dams and Barrages</h2>

  <p>Barrages</p>
  <p>
    One of the last stops on this adventure through clean energy are barrages and I'm st ar ting
    to f eel clo se to t he end...
  </p>

  <h3>How do whey work?</h3>
  <p>
    Let’s talk about how water turbines work. First, water goes through a barge at the bottom
    of the barrage when the sluice gates are open. Sluice gates are two gates that are in front
    of the turbine and behind the turbine that opens to let water out into a bigger body of water,
    and the floor the barrage sits on is called the estuary floor.
  </p>

  <h3>How do they generate energy?</h3>
  <p>
    Now, how do barrages make electricity? Well, when the sluice gates open up water goes through
    the turbines and the water spins the blades that are connected to a generator that is connected
    to a battery. Let’s talk about the upside and then the downside of barrages. First with the
    upsides, as you know this is a renewable energy source and doesn’t release toxic things into
    the water sources unless a serious problem were to happen.
  </p>

  <h3>What are the upsides?</h3>
  <p>
    Now, l et’s talk about the upside and then the downside of barrages. First with the upsides,
    as you know this is a renewable energy source and doesn’t release toxic things into the water
    sources unless a serious problem happens.
  </p>

  <h3>What are the down sides?</h3>
  <p>
    But that leads to the downside of barrages where they can interfere with fish migrations or
    the fact they can hold up water and flood different areas. So barrages might not be the best
    option.
  </p>

  <p>Dams</p>
  <p>
    Last on this adventure through clean energy are dams and wow this long...
  </p>

  <h3>How do whey work?</h3>
  <p>
    Let us talk about dams. Dams work in a very similar way but on a much bigger scale. They have
    all the same upsides but more downsides, like how they’re vulnerable to water scarcity, which
    just makes them a giant vertical slab of concrete. So I think though dams do make more
    electricity they probably aren’t the best option, but that doesn’t mean they’re useless. They
    do keep areas from flooding too! Dams also act as giant batteries to the grid and when there
    is heavy rainfall they are the most reliable source of electricity and are still renewable
    energy sources. Now, how do dams make electricity? Well, when the sluice gates open up water
    goes through the turbines and the water spins the blades that are connected to a generator
    that is connected to a battery. Let’s talk about the upside and then the downside of dams.

  <h3>What are the upsides?</h3>

  <h3>What are the downsides?</h3>

    But that leads to the downside of dams where they can interfere with fish migrations or the
    fact they can hold up water and flood different areas. So like I said ea rlier, dams might not
    be the best option.

  <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
  <p>
    Thanks for reading to the end or maybe your just skiping through to the part you want to learn
    about and thats cool too! Thanks for checking this out and I hope you learned more about the
    future of energy and I hope you read something else I wrote or another website I coded but
    before you use this as a resource you have to look at citations unless your teacher just
    doesn't care which is ok too.

    We are here to talk about clean energy, how it is both good and bad, and how it works. We
    think that fossil fuels are a thing of the past, and yes, that was a fantastic pun. If you're
    wondering where we get our information from, you should check our citation page up there! ☺
